# About [youtube-dl-web](https://github.com/zeljko-m-gavrilovic/youtube-dl-web.git)

[This](https://github.com/zeljko-m-gavrilovic/youtube-dl-web.git) web application is a tiny wrapper around the [youtube-dl](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl) 
and [youtubedl-java](https://github.com/sapher/youtubedl-java) libraries.
It provides an end user functionality to easily download a youtube video or a playlist and eventually 
convert it to the mp3 format.

## Prerequisites

In order to run this application you will need to have the folowing software installed on your 
machine:
* [java](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html),
* [youtube-dl](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl) and
* [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org) or [avconv](https://libav.org) if you need to convert 
from one format to another.

## Run the application

Enter the folder where you cloned [this project](https://github.com/zeljko-m-gavrilovic/youtube-dl-web.git) 
and run the application in a terminal with:

    `java -jar youtube-dl-web-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar`

Open the web browser and go to the application main page 
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Usage

There are basically few functionalities supported: 
* adding a new track info,
* listing the already entered tracks, 
* downloading and converting tracks,
* deleting the track.

Tracks can be downloaded and converted automatically when a new track is added or it can be triggered from 
the listing showing all the entered tracks. Downloaded tracks can be found on a file system inside the folder
of [this project](https://github.com/zeljko-m-gavrilovic/youtube-dl-web.git). 

## Screenshots

GUI part of the application is a matter of a fast change so the screenshots can very soon be out of date but here are 
few of them just to get a "feeling" how does it look:

## Some background info

There are two reasons why I've spent my spare time doing this project.

The first one is that I needed a GUI application to even more easily use the great library
[youtube-dl](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl). It actually already has everything I need. 
There is a CLI and learning just a few options gives you the possibility to easily download 
youtube videos and convert them to mp3 so you can i.e. listen your favourite songs/talks offline 
during the daily routine like driving the car to work and back home. :)

But there is a second reason which prevented me from using some of the already existing GUI applications. 
I needed some playground for learning Clojure. It was a good candidate for a small project where I
could see how does the web development in Clojure differs from the plain/pure Java web development and
to see if it is easy to reuse some of the already existing Java libraries or an external libraries which are not Java native 
like [youtube-dl](https://github.com/zeljko-m-gavrilovic/youtube-dl-web.git).
